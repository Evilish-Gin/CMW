<h2>Top 3 MMO's according to Gin</h2>

<p>
MMO's and playing them casually is the way I like it, I don't rush to the end at break neck speed but rather I take my time and pop in and out and let the game capture me.<br />
Thus far there have been 3 games that have managed for me to return to them despite dropping them several times.<br />

<h3>Black Desert</h3>
<p>Black Desert Online (Korean: 검은사막) is a sandbox-oriented fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) developed by Korean video game developer Pearl Abyss and originally published for Microsoft Windows in 2014.</p> <p>A mobile version titled Black Desert Mobile was initially released in Asia by early 2019, and worldwide in December 2019.</p> <p>The Xbox One and PlayStation 4 versions, known simply as Black Desert, were released in 2019.</p> <p>The game is free-to-play in some parts of the world, but follows a buy-to-play business model in other editions, including the English-language editions.</p>

<p>In 2018, Pearl Abyss began work on a prequel to the timeline of Black Desert, titled Crimson Desert, but during development it became a separate, stand alone IP with a different storyline and new characters.</p>

<p>In 2021, Kakao Games stopped services and Pearl Abyss took back over the publishing rights.</p>
